# Front-End Checkpoint (DOM, React, React-Router)

This checkpoint is primarily to help us understand how well you've absorbed the material covered so far. It covers important front-end concepts, including vanilla DOM manipulation, React, and React-Router.

To this end — and perhaps it goes without saying — we ask that you don't help each other or cheat.
